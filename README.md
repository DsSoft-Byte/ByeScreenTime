# ByeScreenTime
This .mobileconfig (iPhone/iPad/iPod profile) will disable screentime. This requires your device to be "fake supervised", which requires iMazing or to have iSupervisor (if jailbroken).
## This will NOT work without iDevice supervision!
iOS 12-13 tested only! I haven't had the opportunity to test this on iOS 14+
