# ByeScreenTime
This .mobileconfig (iPhone/iPad/iPod profile) will disable screentime. This requires your device to be "fake supervised", which requires iMazing or to have iSupervisor (if jailbroken).
## This will NOT work without iDevice supervision!
iOS 12-14 tested only! I haven't had the opportunity to test this on iOS 15+, but it should work.

## Installation
1. Open [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singlekeycap/ByeScreenTime/master/ByeScreenTime.mobileconfig) in Safari.
2. Hit allow on the pop-up.
3. Go to Settings, and click on `Profile Downloaded`.
4. Hit install.
5. Profit???
